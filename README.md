# higher-lower
## Flask guessing game
- Flask application where the home route displays an <h1> that says "Guess a number between 0 and 9" and display a gif of my choice from giphy.com.
- Generated a random number between 0 and 9 
- Created a route that can detect the number entered by the user e.g "URL/3" or "URL/9" and checks that number against the generated random number.
- If the number is too low, tell the user it's too low, same with too high or if they found the correct number. 
- Made the <h1> text a different colour for each page.
